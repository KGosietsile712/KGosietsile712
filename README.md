- 👋 Hi, I’m @KGosietsile712
- 👀 I’m interested in exploring the intersection of technology and art. From algorithmic art to creative coding projects, I'm always looking for new ways to blend code and creativity.
  Follow along as I push the boundaries of what's possible! 🎨💻 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Software Development 
- 😄 Pronouns: Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I once coded a project entirely in one sitting, fueled by nothing but wine gums and coffee. The result? A functional Access control programme that surprised even me! ☕️💻 #CodeFuel"
